            What Careers are Available in Computer Applications?
            <br><br>
            In general, computer applications professionals design and develop software and computer applications, help implement and test software, and write instruction booklets for potential users of the software. Three possible careers in computer applications include computer programmer, software developer and computer systems analyst. Computer programmers code software to make it operable by computers. This may involve taking programs developed by software developers and writing the coded instructions computers use to run it. Often they are trained to use programming languages such as C++ and Java. Once they have completed this step they test the software to ensure it operates correctly. There are two different types of software developers; applications software developers, and systems software developer. Applications software developers create software that complete specific tasks for users, but is not required for the function of computer system. These types of software may include data bases, spread sheets, word processors and games. Systems software developers create the software that compose an operating system, necessary for computer operations. Before starting a project, professionals in both professions meet with clients to determine their software needs. They then determine what programs are used in that software and map out how they work together. Following this step, they assemble the software and run it through a series of tests to determine if it's functional and meets the client's needs. Computer systems analysts are hired to help companies determine their information technology needs. They need to have a strong knowledge of the technologies available to improve a company's IT system and how to incorporate those technologies in existing systems. They may also be hired to create and install new systems. They manage the installment of these
            systems, then test the systems to ensure they work as planned. Finally, they train users how to use the system.

        <h1> What Will I Do as a Computer Applications Professional?</h1>
        <p> 
                While working as a computer application professional, you work with a team of specialists to develop, design and implement software systems, applications and networks. If you work as a software developer, you may also help identify user needs and assist with the design, coding and testing of new software programs and platforms. Additional responsibilities include collecting data and compiling research documents in order to create and analyze diagrams and flowcharts.
        </p>

        <h1> What Skills Do I Need? </h1>
        <p>
                In order to execute computer tests, you troubleshoot, analyze, debug and fix software and network defects. You need to be familiar with a variety of software platforms and applications as well. It's important to understand coding languages such as C++, Java, Ruby, Python and PHP, as well as CSS and HTML. As a computer application professional, you have to perform
                object-relational modeling, software modeling, database design and software architecture.
