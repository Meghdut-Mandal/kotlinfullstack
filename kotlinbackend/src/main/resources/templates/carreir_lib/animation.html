           <h1> Animation </h1>
        <p>
            Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and change by rapidly displaying set of static images that minimally differ from each other. This technique can be used to bring characters to life and make it appear like they are in motion! Traditionally, stop motion techniques have been used to create animation sequences. It involves photographing the subject one frame at a time and then displaying these images in rapid succession at high frames per second. As an animator, you may make use of techniques like- 2D hand drawing, 2D Computer generated, 3D Computer generated, stop motion or model animation techniques to create animation sequences. The method depends on the specialization that you have (through training and courses). These days, computers and various software are used to create works of animation (2D & 3D). This field is also known as CGI. We see works of animation in our day to day lives in various forms. CGI can be seen in action in movies, cartoons, animated movies, advertisements, TV shows, websites etc.
