            Audiologist Courses and Classes Overview <br>
            Audiologists study, diagnose and treat hearing loss and balance disorders. Courses in audiology are generally taken as part of a full doctoral degree program. Common topics cover acoustical science, amplification and pharmacology, among others.
        </p>

        <h1> Essential Information </h1>
        <p>
            Although undergraduate courses exist, audiologist courses are typically found in graduate degree programs because this specialized profession requires the completion of a doctoral program in audiology. The most common degree available is the Doctor of Audiology (Au.D), although some Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programs do exist for those who'd rather do research than practice audiology in the healthcare industry. Au.D. programs need to have accreditation from the Council on Academic Accreditation in order for their graduates to be able to pursue the state licensure required to practice as an audiologist. <br>
             During the first three years of an Au.D. program, students participate in several practical labs and internship rotations, with courses in acoustical science, amplification, audiologist equipment and auditory anatomy. The last year of the program usually consists entirely of a full-time externship at a healthcare facility. Common topics may include the following:  <br>
             Hearing aids <br> Speech defects <br> Bone structure <br> Balance issues <br> Anatomy <br> Rehabilitation plans
        </p>
