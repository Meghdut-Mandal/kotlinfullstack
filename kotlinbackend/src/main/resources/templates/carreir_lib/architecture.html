           <h1> Architecture </h1>
        <p>
            A rapid economic development in the last few decades coupled with a breakneck pace of urbanization in India has led to an ever increasing demand for creating living spaces that are not only affordable but are aesthetically pleasing too. This real estate boom has imparted a special importance to the job of an architect. Right from the stage of planning a building's design to the stage of actually implementing int on the ground, a career in architecture treads a fine line between art and science. An architect, while designing a structure has to balance a number of factors, ranging from the functional and technical to the aesthetics. This provides an opportunity to both- the artist and the scientist, to tap into their inner potential.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1> Start Early </h1>
        <p>
            A person requires sound communication skills and immense physical stamina to get into the profession of architecture. He is expected to work on desk as well on the construction site. Excellent memory and sound concentration level, flexibility, patience, team spirit, responsibility and accountability, etc. are some common personality traits which are essential for professional success in architecture and design. But it is right credentials in academics which matters most in architecture wherein candidates with Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry at the 10+2 level only can apply for admission to study architecture at the graduate level. Various colleges offer undergraduate course in B.Arch. which lasts for 5 years. The selection is done through an entrance exam conducted by the Council of Architecture throughout India. On the other hand engineering colleges select students on the basis of the result to the appropriate engineering courses. Similarly, some private colleges offering courses in architecture have their own criteria which are based on +2 marks of students. Students interested to further their knowledge in architecture can pursue post-graduation in architecture for two years.    
        </p>

        <h1> Is it the Right Career for Me? </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Architects design structures and give physical face-lift as well as provide functional utility, safety and economy. The job of an architect is not limited to designing corporate offices, rather they design houses, apartments and colonies, industrial complexes, hospitals, hotels, airport terminals, stadium, shopping and commercial complexes, schools etc. Architects focus on how to make living easy and comfortable for people ranging from lower-middle class to upper-class and offer them housing and shelter with luxury and style. Moreover, increased demand for luxury accommodation from certain section of people drives architects to work on building such designs which fulfill the specific requirements. The last century saw tremendous growth in scope of architectural designs. Though architects have been in existence since time immemorial, new concepts and designs as well as implementation of technological inputs increased in last century only. Architects provide professional services to new constructions, alterations and renovations, etc. of the existing buildings.        
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Job Prospects</h1>
        <p>  Architects can work with construction companies wherein they are asked to serve as a designer. Initially an architect is expected to understand specific requirements of clients and strike a right balance between aesthetics and practicality. Additionally, an architect with skills can help clients by his ideas in terms of balancing the requirements of appearance, financial budget and time frame. Some architects even work independently and earn their livelihood through consultancy fees which entirely depends upon the skills and profile as well as work experience. Most of the jobs in architecture come up in government organizations such as Public Works Department, the Archaeological Department, Ministry of Defense, National Building Organization, Town and Country Planning Organization, National Institute of Urban Affairs, Departments of Railways, Post and Telegraphs, Public Sector Undertakings, Housing and Urban Development Corporation, National Building Construction Corporation Ltd., etc. While some other organizations or bodies like State Departments, Housing Boards, Local Bodies for construction works, Builders, Architecture Firms, Consultants, etc. also hire architects. Architects working independently have ample scope in terms of earning. However, the inherent hazard with independent practice is that the professional undergoes lots of work as he alone has to plan details of sizes, specification and estimates of the cost of the structure, etc. Moreover, he require good models and graphics as there would not be any other person to assist him which is the case when he works with some construction company. Specialization works well for better prospects in architecture as it is a matter of requirement. </p>
        <br>
        <h1> Eligibility Criteria  </h1>
        <br>
        <p> The basic requirement for a successful career in architecture completion of a five year undergraduate course after 10+2 with Math and English as mandatory subjects. Most colleges offering the B.Arch. (Bachelor in Architecture) course specify a cut-off of at least 50 percent in 10+2 for admission into their ranks. These architecture courses are recognized by the Council of Architecture (COA) and serve as a springboard for entry into this field. <br> The Indian Institute of Technology (I.I.T.) Kharagpur and Roorkee are among the best architecture colleges in the country. <br> However, to ensure a fruitful career as an architect, a B.Arch. might not be enough. This is where a Master's degree in architecture (M.Arch.) comes in. A Master's degree with a high level of specialization not only guarantees a job but also equips the degree holder with a considerable clout in the job market. An architect is burdened with the responsibility of not only ensuring that his creations are economically viable and environmentally sustainable, he's also tasked with creating structures that fit in with the surroundings. A career in architecture requires flexibility, versatility and a high degree of specialization. The set of skills and expertise required to build a residential apartment are, after all, very different from those required to build a museum. In the design as well as the construction phase, an architect's job is also to ensure that a connection is maintained with the past and the culture of the society. </p>
